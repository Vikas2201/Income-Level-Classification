# Income-Level-Classification

 * This application will be built with Python using the Flask framework and will include a machine learning model that will train to detect whether a person makes over
50K per year or not from classic adult dataset.

 * Do ⭐ the repository , if it helped you in anyway.

# Data Set :

Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) &&(AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)).
